# License Plate Recognition using YOLOv8 and EasyOCR

## Project Overview

This project focuses on license plate recognition using two powerful technologies: YOLOv8 (You Only Look Once) and EasyOCR. The combination of these tools allows for efficient and accurate detection and recognition of license plates from images or video streams.

## Importance of YOLO

YOLO (You Only Look Once) is a state-of-the-art, real-time object detection system. YOLOv8, the latest version, offers several improvements over its predecessors, making it a popular choice for various object detection tasks, including license plate recognition.

- **Speed**: YOLOv8 is designed for real-time processing, making it ideal for applications requiring immediate feedback, such as traffic monitoring and automated toll collection.
- **Accuracy**: The model has high accuracy in detecting objects, ensuring that license plates are correctly identified even in complex scenes.
- **Efficiency**: YOLOv8 is optimized for performance, balancing speed and accuracy, making it suitable for deployment on devices with limited computational resources.

## Importance of EasyOCR

EasyOCR is an Optical Character Recognition (OCR) tool that extracts text from images. It is known for its ease of use and versatility, supporting multiple languages and scripts.

- **Ease of Use**: EasyOCR provides a simple interface for text extraction, making it accessible to users with varying levels of technical expertise.
- **Accuracy**: The tool has high recognition accuracy for a wide range of fonts and styles, crucial for reading text from license plates under different conditions.
- **Language Support**: EasyOCR supports multiple languages, ensuring that license plates from different regions can be recognized accurately.

## Project Structure

- **YOLOv8 Model**: Used for detecting the presence and location of license plates in images or video frames.
- **EasyOCR**: Applied to the detected license plate regions to extract the alphanumeric characters.
